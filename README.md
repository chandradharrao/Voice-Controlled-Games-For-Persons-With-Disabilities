# Voice-Controlled-Games-For-Persons-With-Disabilities

This is a project as part of the DevFest2.0 Hackathon organized by DevSoc Developers' Society,BITS Pilani,Goa Campus.

What and Why?

Arcade hits like PACMAN have been enjoyed with touch and keyboard based controllers for a long time.

But Persons with disability haven't had a chance to enjoy these games to the fullest potential.
Hence the Solution of "Voice based Controller using Speech Recognition" to control games like PACMAN.

How?

Web based PACMAN game which can be controleld using  "WASD" movement or voice commands such as:

"UP" for W

"LEFT" for A

"BOTTOM" for S

"RIGHT" for D
