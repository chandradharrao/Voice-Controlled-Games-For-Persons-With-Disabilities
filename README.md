# Voice-Controlled-Games-For-Persons-With-Disabilities

This is a project as part of the DevFest2.0 Hackathon organized by DevSoc Developers' Society,BITS Pilani,Goa Campus.

What Problems does it solve and Why?

Arcade hits like PACMAN have been enjoyed with touch and keyboard based controllers for a long time.

But Persons with disability haven't had a chance to enjoy these games to the fullest potential.
Hence the Solution of "Voice based Controller using Speech Recognition" to control games like PACMAN without the need of a keyboard or physical interaction with the Computer!

How does it solve the problem?

Web based PACMAN game which can be controleld using  either "WASD" movement or Voice Commands such as:

"UP" for W

"LEFT" for A

"BOTTOM" for S

"RIGHT" for D

TechStack used to solve the problem:

HTML,CSS for the Visuals.

Vanilla Javascript + HTML Canvas to implement the Game Engine.
No external libraries or framework.

Web Speech API inbuilt within Browsers to implement the Speech Recognition Engine.
Web Speech API abstracts the native Speech Recognition Module provided by different Operating Systems.

Future Work:

Add in more classic games like Pong and other popular games like Chrome T-Rex run.

Enhance Pacman with procedural maze generation and Advanced AI behaviour.
